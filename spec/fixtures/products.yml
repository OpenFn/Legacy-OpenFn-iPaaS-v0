  description: Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called
    a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength
    of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots
    get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred
    in one of the ones that became nothing.

  description: Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag
    clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child
    with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
    that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy
    store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping
    for an infant named Jeb.

  description: You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time travel. And when
    we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How it's possible, how it's done, what the
    dangers are. But then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft encounters
    a black hole does the computer call it an 'unknown entry event'? Why don't they
    know? If they don't know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never told
    anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die down here. Just as a matter
    of deductive logic.
